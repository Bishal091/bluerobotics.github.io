# Introduction

<img src="/wteclip/cad/IMG_1856.JPG" class="img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

The Watertight Enclosure *Clip* secures the end cap of the enclosure tube to help prevent unintended opening during operation. Each clip installed on an end cap increases the required pullout force by two kilograms! In case this isn't enough there are cutouts on the arm that allow for a standard ziptie to be tightened around.

# Installation

## Tools Needed
  * M3 Driver
  * X-acto Knife or Box Cutter
  * Ruler
  * Scrap piece of cardboard
  
## Cut the rubber to length

<img src="/wteclip/cad/IMG_1830.JPG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

The provided rubber strip is 32mm by 25.4mm of Neoprene Rubber. This piece needs to be cut down to 8mm by 25.4mm long pieces. Place the rubber strip on a piece of cardboard with the adhesive side facing upwards. Gripping the ends with your thumb and forefinger, cut the strip in half using an X-acto knife. Take one of the halves and cut it in half again to form two 8mm wide by 25.4mm pieces. Keep the extra rubber for replacement in the future. 

## Assemble the Clip

Remove the adhesive backing and firmly press the rubber strip onto the bottom of the clip. 

## Install onto the End Cap

Remove the flange and end cap from the water tight enclosure. If a Go-Pro mount is being used then remove the two M3x12 screws that are above the end cap tabs. Otherwise remove two M3x12 screws that are opposite from each other. Use the M3x16mm screws and washers to loosely tighten the clips into the two free holes such that they do not fall off.

## Tighten the Clips

Place the end cap back onto the Watertight Enclosure with the clips installed. Using the M3 driver tighten the clips until the entirety of the rubber surface lightly makes contact with the tube. This is sufficient pressure to prevent the end cap from coming undone accidentally. **Excessive tightening will damage the threads inside the flange.**
