===================================

This repository is the home to Blue Robotics' product documentation, including product manuals, tutorials, and guides.

How the Website Works

The documentation website uses the [Github Pages feature](https://pages.github.com/) to host the website directly from this repository. The documentation is written in [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) and uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the website.

If you want to play around with it and make modifications, just create a [fork of the repository](https://github.com/bluerobotics/bluerobotics.github.io/fork).

When you've got the files on your computer, you can host the site locally by typing:

```bash
jekyll serve
```

Then visit the site at http://localhost:4000/.

For more information on how to install Jekyll on your computer, visit the [Jekyll website](http://jekyllrb.com/).
