# Introduction

The Fathom Tether is a high quality tether cable designed specifically for ROVs and other subsea applications. 
It is neutrally buoyant, has 350+ lb breaking strength, and is embedded with water-blocking fibers to seal any leaks. The tether has a diameter of 7.6mm and is slimmer than the vast majority of comparable ROV tethers.

We put a lot of time into making sure that it has impeccable electrical qualities. The tether carries four unshielded twisted pairs (UTP) of 26AWG wire. 
These pairs are colored and arranged in the same fashion as a Cat5 networking cable including cross-talk resistance. Each pair is individually jacketed inside the cable to maintain reliable properties and minimize interference between each pair of wires.

The Fathom Tether R2 has a polyurethane outer jacket for better flexibility and adherence to potting material.
 
# Quick Start 

1. Prepare the ends of your tether for use as shown in the installation tutorial.

2. Be sure to tin the ends of the conductors prior to installing the tether into your vehicle.

3. Firmly attach the tether to your vehicle by following the strain relief tutorial or some other method that prevents the tether from pulling directly on the tether penetrator. The tether can twist the penetrator loose if you do not provide strain relief.
