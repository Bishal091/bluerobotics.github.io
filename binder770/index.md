# Introduction

The Binder 770 connector is our standard connector for tether connections above the water. The connectors have 8 pins and are IP67 splashproof when mated, easy to use, and compact. The Binder 770 plug is pre-installed on all Fathom tethers since August 2018, but the standalone connector can be used to retrofit older tethers.

# Specifications

# Assembly

## Introduction

The Binder 770 connector comes with all the parts necessary to solder and secure it to the end of a section of <em>Fathom</em> or <em>Fathom Slim</em> tether. Soldering is of moderate difficulty with small closely spaced contacts.

## Safety 

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> When working with electricity, especially in water, always practice caution. Always ensure that connections are secure and watertight. 

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> Take care when soldering and use caution to avoid injury. 

## Required Tools (Not Included)

- Soldering iron with a small tip
- Solder 
- Small vise or clamp
- Flux (optional)

## Step 1: Preparing the Tether

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1529.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

For both the <em>Fathom</em> and <em>Fathom Slim</em>tethers, strip off 14-20 mm (0.55-0.79 in) of cable jacket, and strip all individual conductions about 2 mm (0.08 in). You can refer to the [Tether Stripping Instructions](/fathom/#installation) for more details.

## Step 2: Tinning the Wire

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1534.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Using a small amount of solder, tin each tether wire.

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1535.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

## Step 3: Tinning the Connector Contacts

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1541.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Using a small amount of solder, tin each Binder connector contact. Only pins one and two need to be tinned if using two wire <em>Fathom Slim</em> tether.

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1546.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:500px"  />

## Step 4: Sliding on the Connector Parts

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1531.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Slide the end piece, white plastic ring, rubber grip, and connector body over onto the tether as shown. Note orientation of the body, the external thread should face away from the bare wire end of the tether.

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1532.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

## Step 5: Soldering the Wire to the Contacts

<img src="/binder770/cad/Customer Soldering Diagram.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />

Solder the tether wires to each contact of the Binder connector in the order indicated in the above diagram. With everything tinned, it should only take a light touch and maybe a drop of additional solder to establish a secure connector. Avoid heat for more than a few seconds per wire to avoid melting the plastic around each contact. 

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1553.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  /> 

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1563.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Take care not to create a solder bridge between the wires, and test the integrity of each connection by gently pulling on the wire.

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1565.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />

Only two wires need to be soldered for <em>Fathom Slim</em> tether.

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1568.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1572.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:500px"  />

## Step 6: Attaching the Connector Body

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1574.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:500px"  />

Slide the connector body up to the contacts, and screw together tightly, taking care not to twist the wires.

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1576.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:500px"  />

## Step 7: Completing the Connector

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1575.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:500px"  />

Slide the remaining grip and end pieces up to the connector body, and screw together tightly, taking care not to twist the wires.

<img src="/binder770/cad/IMG_1577.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:500px"  />

Once complete, it is recommended to use a multimeter to test the continuity of each connection to confirm all solder joints are intact, in the correct order, and with no bridging.
