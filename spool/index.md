# Introduction

The <em>Fathom Spool</em> is a rugged and easy to use tether spool for the <em>Fathom</em> and <em>Fathom Slim</em> ROV tethers. With an integrated slip ring, adjustable drag brake and secure locking cable connectors, it's quick to set up and use in a variety of conditions. Full IP67 water resistance means water splashes are no problem, and a reversible locking handle makes it easy to transport. The <em>Fathom Spool</em> is available in two configurations- a standard width version capable of storing up to 150m of <em>Fathom</em> ROV tether, and a double wide large version capable of storing up to 300m.

Assemble the <em>Fathom Spool</em> according to the following steps, and you can spool and unspool long lengths of tether with ease. Two nylon brake screws in the side panels can be tightened or loosened to adjust the rolling resistance of the <em>Fathom Spool</em> as desired. The handle can be removed and installed in reverse with the alternate mounting cutouts to lock the spool in place and keep the handle tucked away for each transportation. Cable management cutouts on the side panels can be used to secure the free end of the tether.

## Required Thread Locker Application

<img src="/brov2/cad/brov2-loctite-applied.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

**All machine threaded screws must have thread locker applied during assembly.** Apply one drop of thread locker to the bottom of each screw, and roll the screw around on a paper towel to evenly spread the threadlocker and remove excess. Apply thread locker using this technique to each machine threaded screw before using it.

## Step 1: Assembling the Feet

NOTE: This step may already be completed when you receive your <em>Fathom Spool</em>.

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step1.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

For the standard version, with a 2.5 mm hex driver use two threadlocked M4x10 screws to attach two rubber feet to the bottom of each frame foot. Repeat to make two units.

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step1-large.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  /> 

For the large version, with a 2.5 mm hex driver use three threadlocked M4x10 screws to attach three rubber feet to the bottom of each frame foot.

## Step 2: Assembling the First Frame Half

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step2.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Using six threadlocked M4x20 screws and a 2.5 mm hex driver, screw the two feet and single frame handle to the same side of a side panel, rubber feet point down. Tighten the screws until they indent the plastic slightly. Note the round handle goes to the rounded tip at the top of the frame.

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step2-large.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

## Step 3: Attaching the Slip Ring Core to the First Flange 

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step3.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Use four threadlocked M5x12 screws and a 3.0 mm hex driver to attach the slip ring core to a flange. Note the screw heads come through the plastic flange to screw into the aluminum slip ring core, and the long end of the core should be passed through the central hole in the flange. Tighten the screws until they indent the plastic slightly.

## Step 4: Adding the Spool Standoffs

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step4-alt.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

For the standard version, use six threadlocked M5x12 screws and a 3.0 mm hex driver to secure the six spool standoffs to the outermost holes on the inside face of the spool, facing the same direction as the long end of the core. Tighten the screws until they indent the plastic slightly.

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step4-large.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

For the large version, use six threadlocked M5x16 screws instead and a 3.0 mm hex driver to secure the six spool standoffs and one stiffening ring, with the stiffening ring placed between the standoffs and the spool face. Match the stiffening ring cutout pattern to the spool face. Tighten the screws until they indent the plastic slightly.

## Step 5: Attaching the Crank Arm Hub to the Second Flange

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step5.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Using four threadlocked M5x12 screws and a 3.0 mm hex driver, secure the crank arm hub to the second flange. Note the screw heads come through the plastic flange to screw into the aluminum crank arm hub, and the short end of the core should be passed through the central hole in the flange. The two teeth on the crank arm hub should line up with two splines on the flange. If they do not, rotate 90° and secure. In addition, the flange should be oriented with the splines curving as shown. Press the black plastic plug in the hole in the crank arm hub. Tighten the screws until they indent the plastic slightly.

## Step 6: Adding the Tether Securing Clips

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> DO NOT use threadlocker for this step.

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step6-alt.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

For the standard version, use three #8-1/4" self tapping screws and a #2 Phillips head driver to secure three nylon clamps the inside face of the flange where the plug is located. The clamps should be mounted next to each other in the second from outermost holes.

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step6-large.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

For the large version, use three #8-1/2" self tapping screws instead and a #2 Phillips head driver to secure the clips against the face of the stiffening ring. Match the stiffening ring cutout pattern to the spool face.

## Step 7: Combining the Flanges

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step7.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Attach the two flanges to each other with six threadlocked M5x12 screws, locating the standoffs in the outermost ring of holes. Use two 3.0mm hex drivers, one on each side of the assembly, to tighten each pair of screws per standoff in sequence. Tighten the screws until they indent the plastic slightly.

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step7-large.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

## Step 8: Completing the Frame

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step8.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Mount the spool assembly to the partially assembled first frame half, and then use six threadlocked M4x20 screws and a 2.5 mm hex driver to capture the assembly by completing the frame with the second frame panel. The spool assembly can be mounted in either orientation so that the crank handle can be on either side according to personal preference. Pictured is the left handed cranking orientation. Note the round handle goes to the rounded tip at the top of the frame. Tighten the screws until they indent the plastic slightly.

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step8-large.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

## Step 9: Securing the Slip Ring Core

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step9.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Secure the slip ring core with the blue slip ring cap flange, attaching with four #4-5/8" self tapping screws and a #1 Pillips head driver on the outer holes to the plastic frame, and four threadlocked M3x6 screws with a 2.5 mm hex driver on the inner holes to the aluminum slip ring core. The slip ring core should be oriented such that the white strip on the Binder 770 connector faces up as much as possible.

<img src="/spool/cad/IMG_1601.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px" />

## Step 10: Adding the Braking Thumbscrews

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step10.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Screw two 1/4"-20 nylon thumbscrews all the way down into the threaded holes in the center of the long edge of each of the frame panels, then back off one half turn.

## Step 11: Assembling the Crank

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> DO NOT use threadlocker for this step.

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step11.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Use two M4x20 screws and a 2.5 mm hex driver to secure the crank handle to the crank arm. The crank arm can curve to either direction according to aesthetic preference. DO NOT use threadlocker.

## Step 12: Attaching the Crank

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> DO NOT use threadlocker for this step.

<img src="/spool/cad/spool-step12.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px"  />

Use the aluminum thumbscrew to attach the crank to the crank hub to complete your <em>Fathom Spool</em>. No threadlock is needed, the thumbscrew is designed to be removeable.

<img src="/spool/cad/IMG_1078.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px" />

# Mounting the Tether

A Binder 770 connector is required on the topside end of your tether to enable use with the <em>Fathom</em> Spool. If your tether does not have a Binder 770 connector installed, refer to the [Binder 770 Installation Tutorial](/binder770/). 

## Step 1: Preparing the Connector

<img src="/spool/cad/IMG_1088.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

Rotate the locking collar on the tether Binder 770 connector to line up the white vertical arrow with the rounded tooth on the interior. This puts the connector in the unlocked position.

## Step 2: Loosening the Tether Clips

<img src="/spool/cad/IMG_1596.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

Loosen the three white tether retaining clips so they easily swing up.

## Step 3: Guiding in the Tether

<img src="/spool/cad/IMG_1096.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

Pass the tether to the interior of the spool between two of the blue standoffs just ahead of the tether retaining clips.

## Step 4: Securing the Connection

<img src="/spool/cad/IMG_1097.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

Connect the tether to the slip ring core, rotating the locking collar to lock the connector in place.

<img src="/spool/cad/IMG_1099.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

## Step 5: Securing the Tether

<img src="/spool/cad/IMG_1100.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

Feed the tether into each of the three retaining clips, keeping some slack in the cable where it goes to the connector. Re-tighten the retaining clips to secure the tether. If using <em>Fathom</em> Slim tether, loop the tether around each clip once in addition to passing it through for security.

<img src="/spool/cad/IMG_1102.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

## Step 6: Winding the Tether

<img src="/spool/cad/IMG_1104.png" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:800px" />

Using one hand, crank the spool while using the other hand to keep the tether taut and feed it in evenly. Wind over the entire width of the spool before winding another layer to maximize space efficiency and neatness.

# Maintenance

The <em>Fathom</em> Spool has a rugged design which does not require much maintenance. 

## After Every Use

- Wipe down the unit with fresh water to remove salt residue. 
- Check for and re-tighten any screws that may be loose. A new application of thread locker may be necessary.
- Inspect and clean the contacts of the Binder 770 connectors if necessary.


## Every 100 Hours of Operation or Every 6 Months

- Check the operation and condition of the sealing x-ring in the slip ring core. If there is significant resistance or rough running, inspect with the following steps:

	1. Loosen the connector on the outside of the unit to break the seal and open an air vent. 

	2. Remove the four #4-5/8" self tapping screws around the perimeter of the blue slip ring cap flange. 

	3. The slip ring cap can now be pulled straight away from the unit, and the x-ring can be inspected for wear. If there is excessive wear it should be replaced. Re-grease if necessary.

	4. Reverse the steps for reassembly, making sure to fully tuck the slip ring wires into the cap before replacing it to avoid pinching or cutting any wires.
