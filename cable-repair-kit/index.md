# Introduction

The *Field Repair Kit* has all of the materials necessary to temporarily repair damaged cable or tether. Rather than turning back from completing a dive after an accident, the Field Repair Kit allows you to keep going! The kit contains two specialized tapes: Coax Seal and Silicone Tape. The Coax Seal is a hand moldable plastic that adheres to many different surfaces and forms a waterproof barrier. The Silicone tape is applied on top of the Coax Seal to provide rigidity and protect the repair from debris.

We have been using the kit to fix nicked and severed cables bla bla. Something about testing to 1000m bla bla. Maybe something about penetrators bla.

Get creative!


## Warnings

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> Waterproofing with the Field Repair Kit is highly dependent on the quality of the repair. There are no guarantees that these methods will work everytime.

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i>  These methods are only meant as a stop gap to finish a days work. Any field repairs should be fixed properly as soon as possible.


## Tools You Need

* Acetone or Isopropyl Alcohol (Optional)

# Instructions

## Surface Preparation 

** Picture - nick in cable that is cleaned up **

Wipe the affected area clean of any debris or moisture. Optionally, one can use a small amount of acetone or isopropyl alcohol on a towel to wipe around the area to be repaired. *Although not entirely necessary, cleaning the cable jacket with an astringent will ensure the best possible seal.* 


## Prepare the Coax Seal

** Picture - Nick + coax seal **

Cut a piece of coax seal to apply to the affected area. The length depends on the type of repair you are performing. We typically use XXX for an XXX long nick and XXX for a severed cable. 

** Picture - massaged end applied to cable just below nick **

Massage the end of the coax seal to form a wide gripping area. Press the coax seal into the cable approximately 2cm below the affected area. 

## Wrap the Coax Seal

** Picture - wrapping the cable **

Slightly stretch the coax seal as you wrap it around the cable. Make sure to overlap the previous winding by about 50% each time. Continue wrapping in this manner until you terminate approximately 2cm above the affected area. *Don't worry if you run out of coax seal, just cut another piece and press it into the other material.* 

## Form the Coax Seal

** Picture - massaging the coax seal **

Use your hands to gently mold coax seal into one contiguous piece. This doesn't have to be perfect, just enough so that any air has been forced out and the overlap joints are smooth.

## Wrap the Silicone Tape

** Picture - overwrapping with silicone tape **

Cut off a similar length of silicone tape. Beginning slightly below the coax seal, wrap the silicone tape around the affected area while overlapping the previous winding by 50% each time.

## Removing the Repair

** Picture - using x-acto knife to cut off repair **

The coax seal and silicone tape will form a strong bond making it difficult to traditionally remove the repair. The best way to remove the wrapping is to use a blade and slice the repair down the middle.
