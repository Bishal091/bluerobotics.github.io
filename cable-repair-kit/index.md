# Introduction

The *Cable Repair Kit* has all of the materials necessary to temporarily repair damaged cable or tether. The kit contains two specialized materials: Coax Seal and Silicone Tape. The Coax Seal is a hand moldable, non-toxic, non-conductive plastic that adheres to most surfaces and the Silicone Tape is a UV resistant stretchy tape that fuses only to itself. When used in a repair the coax seal forms a watertight barrier and the silicone tape is used to provide rigidity and to protect from debris. With these tools in hand a day of diving doesn't have to be called off because of a damaged cable, just perform a field repair and keep going!

We have been using the kit to fix nicked and severed cables bla bla. Something about testing to 1000m bla bla. Maybe something about penetrators bla.




## Warnings

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i>  **These repairs are not permanent. Any repairs should be fixed properly as soon as possible.**

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> **The waterproofness of the repair is highly dependent on the quality of the repair. There is no guarantee that these methods will work every time.**

# Instructions

## Tools You Need

* Scissors
* Acetone or Isopropyl Alcohol (Optional)

## Surface Preparation

<img src="/cable-repair-kit/cad/IMG_1356.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:400px"  />

Wipe the affected area clean of any debris or moisture. Optionally one can use a small amount of acetone or isopropyl alcohol with a towel to wipe around the area to be repaired. *Although not necessary, cleaning the cable jacket with an astringent will ensure the best possible seal.* 


## Prepare the Coax Seal

<img src="/cable-repair-kit/cad/IMG_1350.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:400px"  />
<img src="/cable-repair-kit/cad/IMG_1357.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:400px"  />

Cut a piece of coax seal to apply to the affected area. The length depends on the type of repair you are performing. We typically use XXX for an XXX long nick and XXX for a severed cable.

<img src="/cable-repair-kit/cad/IMG_1358.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:400px"  />

Massage the end of the coax seal to form a wide gripping area. Press the coax seal into the cable approximately 2cm below the affected area. 

## Wrap the Coax Seal

<img src="/cable-repair-kit/cad/IMG_1359.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:400px"  />

Slightly stretch the coax seal as you wrap it around the cable. Make sure to overlap the previous winding by about 50% each time. Continue wrapping in this manner until you terminate approximately 2cm above the affected area. *Don't worry if you run out of coax seal, just cut another piece and press it into the other material.* 

## Form the Coax Seal

<img src="/cable-repair-kit/cad/IMG_1353.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:400px"  />

Use your hands to gently mold coax seal into one contiguous piece. This doesn't have to be perfect, just enough so that any air has been forced out and the overlap joints are smooth.

## Wrap the Silicone Tape

<img src="/cable-repair-kit/cad/IMG_1355.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:400px"  />
<img src="/cable-repair-kit/cad/IMG_1360.jpg" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:400px"  />


Cut off a similar length of silicone tape. Beginning slightly below the coax seal, wrap the silicone tape around the affected area while overlapping the previous winding by 50% each time.

## Removing the Repair

~~The coax seal and silicone tape will form a strong bond making it difficult to traditionally remove the repair. The best way to remove the wrapping is to use a blade and slice the repair down the middle.~~
