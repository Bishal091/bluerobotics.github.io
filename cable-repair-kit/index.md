# Introduction

The *Cable Repair Kit* has all of the materials necessary to temporarily repair damaged cable or tether. The kit contains two specialized materials: Coax Seal and Silicone Tape. The Coax Seal is a hand moldable, non-toxic, non-conductive plastic that adheres to most surfaces and the Silicone Tape is a UV resistant and flexible ~~stretchy~~ tape that fuses only to itself. When used in a repair the coax seal forms a watertight barrier and the silicone tape is used ~~to provide rigidity and~~ to protect from debris. With these tools in hand a day of diving doesn't have to be called off because of a damaged cable, just perform a field repair and keep going!

We spent quite a bit of time testing out these tools and trying out different ways to apply them. Our best cable repair lasted to a full 1000m in the Crushinator! ~~Checkout the instructions below to see how we did it!~~

## Warnings

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i>  **The Cable Repair Kit isn't a permanent solution. Any repairs should be properly fixed as soon as possible.**

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw fa-2x text-warning"></i> **~~A leak in the cable repair could leak into the ROV. There is no guarantee that these methods will work every time.~~**

# Instructions

## Tools You Need

* Scissors
* ~~Acetone Wipes~~

## Surface Preparation

Wipe the affected area clean of any debris or moisture. Use an acetone wipe to further prepare the surface. ~~*Although optional, cleaning the cable jacket with acetone will ensure the best possible repair.*~~ 


## Prepare the Coax Seal


<img src="/cable-repair-kit/cad/Coax-Cut.JPG" class="img-responsive img-center" style="max-width:600px"  />

Cut a piece of coax seal to apply to the affected area. *Don't worry if its not enough, more can be added during the repair.*

**Wrong Picture** Massage the end of the coax seal to form a wide gripping area. Press the coax seal into the cable slightly below the affected area. 

## Wrap the Coax Seal

Stretch the coax seal as you wrap it around the cable. Overlap the previous winding by about 50% each time. ~~Continue wrapping in this manner until you terminate approximately 2cm above the affected area.~~

## Form the Coax Seal

Use your fingers to gently mold the coax seal into one ~~contiguous~~ smooth piece. This doesn't have to be perfect, just enough so that the joints are smooth and any air has been forced out.

## Wrap the Silicone Tape

Cut off a similar length of silicone tape. Start wrapping the silicone tape below the coax seal. Overlap the previous winding by about 50% each time.


## Finished

## Removing the Repair

~~The coax seal and silicone tape will form a strong bond making it difficult to traditionally remove the repair. The best way to remove the wrapping is to use a blade and slice the repair down the middle.~~
